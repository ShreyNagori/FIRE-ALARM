Project Title: Fire Alarm System

Objective: 
The goal of this project is to design a fire alarm system that uses a flame sensor and an Arduino Uno to detect the presence of fire and sound an alarm. 
The system will alert the homeowner or building occupants of a fire, allowing them to evacuate the area quickly and safely.

Components:
Arduino Uno
Flame Sensor
Piezo Buzzer
Jumper Wires
Breadboard

Functionality:
The flame sensor will be used to detect the presence of fire. 
When the flame sensor detects a fire, it will trigger the piezo buzzer to sound an alarm. 
The buzzer will continue to sound until the fire is extinguished or the system is manually reset. 
The Arduino Uno will be used to control the flame sensor and the piezo buzzer.

Setup:
Connect the flame sensor to the Arduino board.
Connect the piezo buzzer to the Arduino board.
Connect the jumper wires to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board, flame sensor, and piezo buzzer.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Code:
The code for the fire alarm system will be written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
The code will use the library for the flame sensor to detect the presence of fire. The code will include conditional statements to ensure that the buzzer only sounds when a fire is detected. 
The code will also include a reset button or function to manually reset the system after a fire.

Conclusion:
The fire alarm system using a flame sensor and an Arduino Uno is a simple and effective solution for detecting fires and alerting building occupants. 
This system combines the capabilities of both the flame sensor and the piezo buzzer to create a reliable fire detection system. With its easy setup and customizable code, this system is a great choice for anyone looking to improve their fire safety measures.
